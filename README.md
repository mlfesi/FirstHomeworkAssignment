# Robinhood Markets, Inc.

## Overview and Origin

Robinhood Markets, Inc. was founded by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt in 2013.  Prior to founding Robinhood, both Tenev and Bhatt had build high frequency trading platforms for various US financial Instituions.  The firm was founded on the ideal of "democratizing finance for all" and targets a younger, tech savvy retail investing clients.

Robinhood received seed funding in 2013 of $3mm from arious individual investors and several venture capital firms, including Andreessen Horowitx.  Prior to their IPO in 2021, Robinhood raised 11 funding rounds for a total of $5.6Bn.

## Business Activities

Robinhood is an online discount brokerage firm focused on retail, tech savvy investors that may have smaller amounts to invest.  Robinhood offers online trading but also offers a mobile application that allows for trading equities, buying and selling cryptocurrencies and a limited menu of commodities.  Robinhood also allows fractional share purchases and sales.  All Robinhood equities and cryptocurrency trades are commission free in alignment with the ideal of providing market access to smaller retail investors.  As of 2021, Robinhood has 13 million users with an average user age of 31 years.

## Landscape

In 2020, there were approximately 3,500 FINRA registered broker firms, generating pretax net income of #77BN.  The US Security Broker Dealer market is large.   Robinhood has followed the trend of most discount broker dealers of offering a mobile platform for trading and a sleek interface that provides real time quotes and "Snacks", a breif newsletter published daily that covers news and market trends.  Within the discount broker dealer space, more competitors are providing mobile access, and many large firms such as Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Vangaurd had begun offering commission free trades for retail investors.  It is important to note that large competitors mimicking Robinhoods offering are traditional broker dealers who also derive fee income, Robinhood derives its revenue with a Payment for Order Flow model, whereby they are compensated by larger broker dealers for Robinhood orders to be routed through them.  This revenue model has generated some controversey - particularly in heavily traded "meme stocks" such as GME and AMC, which found Robinhood limiting or stopping order processing for periods of time resulting in speculation that larger firms with better balance sheet support for their trading activities would not have had to hald trades.  Robinhood confirmed that the trade bands were not the result of net capital pressures, but the event caused some reputational damange.

## Results

Robinhood has enjoyed a great deal of success, leveraging technology to create a user friendly platform, provide commission free trades, and increase retail investor access to cryptocurrencies and financial markets.  Robinhood's competitors have quickly replicated some of Robinhood's key competitive advantages, also offering mobile access and commission free trades.  I don't have any recommendations on new technology to use but my recommendation for Robinhood would be that they constantly evaluate their product offerings, and their financial education offerings delivered on a mobile platform to ensure that they remain relevant for their target customer base of young retail investors
